# Docker Build Failure Due to Missing Dependencies

This repository demonstrates a common Docker build error caused by missing or incorrect dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.  The original `Dockerfile` attempts to install dependencies, but fails because of issues with the dependencies themselves.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly specify and install the dependencies.

## Problem

The initial `Dockerfile` uses `RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, but there's a problem with how the `requirements.txt` file lists the dependencies.  This may involve typos, version incompatibility issues, or missing dependencies. 

## Solution

The corrected `Dockerfile` fixes the issues in `requirements.txt`. The dependencies are corrected to use a proper version and or added if missing. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to build the initial `Dockerfile` using `docker build -t my-app .`  This will fail.
3. Build the corrected `Dockerfile.fixed` using `docker build -t my-app-fixed .`. This will build successfully.
